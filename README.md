# running
Simple GUI for training data -- just started :-)
No Java 21 features are used, the jdk version may be adjusted.

The project is in a very raw stage

## Getting started
It is assumed that the xml data is acessible in a local directory

* build with eclipse
* start main in the Launch class
* select File -> Read Data from the menu
* select the directory containing the xml data files (garmin format)
The calendar is not refreshed, step to another month and the data will be displayed.
